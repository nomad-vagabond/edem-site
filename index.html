                        <p class="big-first">Europa is the second and the smallest of the four Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter. Being slightly smaller than Earth's moon, it orbits Jupiter every 3.5 days and is locked by gravity to Jupiter, so the same hemisphere of the moon always faces the planet.</p>

                        <p>Europa has the smoothest surface of any known solid object in the Solar System, which consists of water ice and crisscrossed by long, linear fractures. Based on the small number of craters observed, the surface of this moon appears to be no more than 40 to 90 million years old, which is quite young in geologic terms. </p>

                        <p>The apparent youth and smoothness of the surface have led to the hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it, which could conceivably harbor extraterrestrial life. While evidence for this internal ocean is quite strong, its presence awaits confirmation by future missions. And the most challenging one would be an ice penetrating mission that will be targeted at taking water probes and reaching the ocean floor in search for possible life forms.</p>

                    <p class="big-first">Europa is unique among the large icy satellites. Its geodynamically active and relatively thin (3…30 km thick) ice crust covers the global water ocean that may reach over 100 km in depth. Along with a liquid ocean, Europa also likely harbors a rocky seafloor that can supply energy and elements needed to drive metabolism. </p>

                    <p>Europa’s unusual surface is dominated by tectonic features in the form of linear ridges, bands, and fractures. The most striking of them are dark streaks crisscrossing the entire globe, called lineae. The most likely hypothesis states that the lineae on Europa may have been produced by a series of eruptions of warm ice as the crust spread open to expose warmer layers beneath. The signs of some surface activity that may be water plumes have been detected recently by the Hubble telescope. But still there is no solid evidence that water from the inner ocean is able to reach the surface through cracks in the ice crust.</p> 

                    <p>This leads to the necessity in considering different possible ways of reaching Europa's inner ocean in the frame of future landing missions.

                <h2>Ice penetration methods</h2>

                <p class="big-first">The heat from tidal flexing allows the Europa's subsurface ocean to remain liquid. But several kilometers of ice above it defy the ingenuity of ice penetration tools that will constitute the payload of the future landing mission to Europa.</p>

                <p>There exist several concepts of the Europa's ice crust penetration methods, mainly based on the drilling or ice-melting principles. These techniques require large amount of input energy to drill or melt down several-km ice crust, which may contain fragments or even layers of more dense material. This leads to the need of using nuclear-powered autonomous ice penetrators, capable of dealing with possible obstacles inside deep layers of ice.</p>

                <!-- <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/rps/types.cfm">radioisotope power system</a> -->

                <p>In its turn, heavy drilling/melting machinery has to be gently delivered to the surface of Europa, so a huge amount of rocket fuel has to be burned out for deceleration and landing. This will put the lander's weight up and shorten the range of available launch vehicles.</p>

            <div class="col-md-6 underice-block top-offset">
                <h2>EDEM approach</h2>

                <p class="big-first">Europa Direct Encounter Mission (EDEM) - is a brand new concept of a landing mission to Europa with optional ice penetration capabilities via kinetic impact of penetration assets with the icy surface of the moon. The mission concept is based on the application of an ultra-strong momentum exchange tether that serves for efficient deceleration of the Europa landing module and acceleration of the ice-penetration assets.</p>

                <p>EDEM is developed with respect to the evolving technologies that will become mature by the end of the next decade, when more information about Europa's ice crust is available from the <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/europaflyby/indepth" target="_blank">Europa Multiple Flyby Mission</a>. Particulary, ultra-strong carbon-nanotube tether, similar to one that might be used in construction of the Space Elevator, is in the core of the concept. Such tether, spinned up by a pair of ion thrusters, is capable of providing velocity of several km/s on its endings. At the moment of tether release spacecraft modules, attached to the endings of the tether, will experience increase or decrease in their linear velocities depending on the direction of the tether rotation. Thus, penetration assets will experience addition in their orbital velocity, increasing the impact energy to form a deep tunnel in ice and thus reducing the working path of the drilling or ice-melting equipment that will be delivered to the impact site by the landing module. On other hand, lander will lose significant amount of delta-v, which will significantly decrease the amount of rocket propellant, needed for deceleration and landing of the spacecraft on the surface of Europa.</p>

                    <p class="big-first">Penetration through the Europa's ice crust with kinetic impact requires application of dense projectiles, capable of withstanding high heat flux. Since the path of the projectile in ice is related to its velocity and diameter, maximization of these parameters is highly desirable. Unfortunately, maximization of the projectile's diameter is limited by the weight constraints.</p>

                    <p>Another possible way of increasing the penetration depth is through applying several projectiles aimed in the same point. In this scenario a chain of impactors must be oriented along the velocity vector, so each new impact will increase the depth of the well left by the previous impact.</p>

                    <p>The shape of the projectile also plays important role in the formation of an elongated well. The problem of selecting proper shape, size and amount of projectiles is an ongoing research.</p>

                    <p id="velocity-undertext">The increase of the impact velocity can be achieved by several means.

                <p class="big-first">In order to be more efficient than a regular rocket thruster, momentum exchange tether must be made of an extremely strong and light material. The preferred tensile strength of such material must be over 80 GPa, which is theoretically achievable for future carbon nanotube-based fibers with density of ~1300 kg/m^3.</p>

                <p>With desired tangential velocities at the endings of the tether, its length will exceed several hundreds of kilometers. Considering a range of issues connected with deployment of such long tether in Low Earth Orbit and significant time, needed to reach the final angular velocity, best solution is to accelerate the tether rotation during the interplanetary flight phase. </p>

                <p>Such acceleration can be provided by the pair of ion thrusters that will start working at the very beginning of the passive interplanetary flight, till reaching desired velocity on the approach to the Jovian System. The interplanetary flight will take up to 6-7 years with consideration of the efficient trajectory with multiple gravity assist maneuvers. Similar trajectories have been selected for all spacecraft that traveled to outer planets and beyond, including Voyager, Gallileo, Cassini and Juno. </p>


                <p>Such long time of the flight is just enough for a pair of ion thrusters to accelerate the tether to the desired angular velocity. The thrusters will be mounted on two separate modules. One of them consists of an Europa lander and kinetic ice penetration assets (optionally). Another - is an empty rocket's upper stage, that will be thrown away into a deep space after tether release on the approach to Europa.</p>

                <p>Ion thrusters will be feeded from two power sources: lander's radioisotope generator and solar pannels, mounted on the rocket's upper stage. Being extremely efficient type of rocket propulsion, ion thrusters will slowly accumulate the portion of input energy into the tether's rotation that will be shared between two spacecraft modules in the moment of tether release.</p>

                <p>At the moment of spacecraft launch from the Earth's surface the tether is winded around the spool, and will be slowly released during all time of the spacecraft angular acceleration to preserve the desired tension and keep the values of the overloads in the allowed range.</p>

With such long tether the whole momentum exchange system will be rotating with very low angular velocity, which makes it possible for steering engines to compensate the errors in direction and attitude.</p>

                <p>There are many possible scenarios of tether release for the spacecraft modules, but not all of them are efficient. Considering the need in maximizing resultant velocity of the penetration assets and minimizing resultant velocity of the lander, the optimal spacecraft separation scheme consists of two steps.</p>

                <p>According to this scheme an angle between the spacecraft velocity vector and the direction into the center of Jupiter, at the moment of entering the Jupiter's sphere of gravitational influence, must be held strictly to ensure that the spacecraft hyperbolic trajectory has a perijove in the Europa's orbit and Europa will be in the right position at the moment of encounter.</p>

                <p class="block-p">At the distance r from Jupiter penetration assets will separate from one of the spacecraft modules, so that its resultant trajectory is targeted towards the oncoming Europa. This will increase the impact velocity by the Europa's orbital velocity and a bit more due to the Europa's gravity. In such scenario the impact velocity can reach 30..40 km/s depending on the distance from Jupiter at the moment of separation.</p>

                <p class="block-p">The rest of the spacecraft will lose a portion of its angular momentum, but will keep enough energy for the second separation to be efficient. It will keep moving along its trajectory to meet an outgoing Europa in the perijove.</p>

                <p class="block-p">At the moment of close approach to Europa the spacecraft modules will separate from the tether so that the lander will be targeted against the system's linear velocity vector and the counterweight (empty booster) will be targeted along it. So, the lander's resultant velocity will be the difference between its tangential velocity of the rotation motion and the spacecraft's linear velocity. In the best possible case the value of the resultant velocity will be close to the Europa's orbital velocity.</p>

                <p class="block-p">After the direct placement in the Europa Low Orbit by releasing the tether, the lander can use its low-thrust chemical rocket engines to land near the site of the impact. The well in the ice crust will serve as a guiding route for the autonomous vehicle to sink down to the deep layers of the pliable warm ice, or directly into the liquid ocean.</p>

At the moment of launch from Earth these modules are assembled in a single piece and the tether is reeled on the spool that is placed between the modules.</p>

It will accelerate the spacecraft to reach the required Earth escape velocity. After its end of work the booster will not separate from the spacecraft, but will serve as a counterweight in the tethered system. For these reasons it will be equipped with spin-producing ion thruster (or a set of ion thrusters) and solar panels.</p>

                <p>The lander, which makes up the spacecraft's second module, is equipped with the same ion thruster to produce a pure angular momentum in the tethered system. Application of thrusters with equal thrust allows to eliminate undesirable forces that may change the spacecraft trajectory. The main lander's payload is an autonomous underwater vehicle powered by radioisotope generator (RTG). The required output power of the RTG is estimated in the range 7-10 kW. It utilizes Stirling engine for the conversion of thermal energy to electrical, so the efficiency of this process is around 35%. This is very high value comparing to thermoelectric elements that have been used on all previous deep space spacecraft.</p>

                <p>The energy produced by the RTG will be used by the lander's spin-producing ion thruster during the interplanetary flight. After the landing on Europa surface it will be the source for producing the ice-melting heat or torque in drilling tool. In the case of successful application of the kinetic penetration assets, the AUV will easily get to the deep ice layers trough the well, left after the impact with kinetic penetrators, so the power of 7-10 kW will be enough for penetration through warm ice layers.</p>

                <p>The kinetic penetration assets, is an optional payload. Their efficiency still has to be proven by the series of numerical simulations and laboratory tests. This is the subject of ongoing research. If included in the payload, they probably will be attached to the second module. The set of impactors will be mounted on the adapter, equipped with attitude control engines. After separation from the rotating spacecraft these engines will be used to form the sequence of impactors, oriented along the vector that is collinear to the velocity vector at the moment of impact. This will ensure that all impactors will hit the ice in the same point.</p>

                    <p class="block-p big-first">The key component of the lander's payload is an autonomous underice/underwater vehicle (AUV). Its main purpose is to efficiently penetrate through the Europa's ice crust, analyze composition of the inner ocean and seek for possible signs of extraterrestrial life.</p>

                    <p class="block-p">It should be able not only to survive in tough environment of the unexplored icy world, but also to freely move in water and ice, overcome any obstacle on its way and autonomously make decisions. These requirements define a new frontier for modern robotics and artificial intelligence.</p>

                    <p class="block-p">The need of ice-penetrating capabilities to be incorporated in the AUV design puts the limit on its shape and size. A series of researches devoted to the development of ice-melting robotic probes (links) has shown that with power input of ~10 kW, the probe's diameter shouldn't exceed 0.5 m. This defines the elongated shape for the AUV, and, with mobility requirement in mind, it should probably be a snake- or worm-shaped robot.</p>

                    <p class="block-p">The Iceworm is a prototype of a robotic probe that will be delivered to the Europa surface by the EDEM spacecraft's landing module. It consists of 4 octagonal modules, connected by flexible junctions, capable of bending into the U shape. This allows the AUV to be compactly packed inside the lander with high packing density.</p>

                    <p class="block-p">The most valuable payload of the Iceworm and the whole mission - a chemical and biological micro laboratory, is situated in the head of the AUV. Its frontal face is equipped with powerful LED light, stereo optical cameras, sonar and infrared sensor. In order to be able to grab specimens, first module of the Iceworm is equipped with two robotic arms, capable of delivering samples into the vaults of the inner laboratory. These vaults are represented by the number of drawers of different sizes. </p>

                    <p class="block-p">Second module - is responsible for motion control. Here the most part of water turbines are placed. The 4 pieces of folding hydrodynamic surfaces in the control module, complemented with the similar set in the tail module, allow to perform efficient maneuvers in water. They can be used to replace the propulsion function of the pair of folding turbines, situated in the same control module, in the case of failure. Other types of propulsion systems - are lateral turbines, allowing to adjust the position of the Iceworm's center of mass, or perform snaky moves.</p>

                    <p class="block-p">Another important purpose of the control module - is to host four microdrones. These satellites are crucial for solving risky tasks and grabbing tiny samples of materials. They can perform autonomously, or via the power cables. Microdrones are equipped with small robotic hands and can efficiently maneuver in water using a set of folding and rotary turbines.

                    <p>Two last modules of the Iceworm are dedicated to the nuclear power sources. The Stirling Radioisotope Generator (SRG) of the third module produces more than a half of the electrical energy, consumed by all systems of the Iceworm. The tail module contains second SRG. It can work in two modes - generator and heater. Last one is essential for heating the water, sucked from the melted exterior ice and push it out from the jets in the tail to melt the ice below. Thus, during the ice penetration phase of its motion Iceworm moves backwards.</p>

                    <p>As it will be targeted to the bottom of the Europa's underice ocean, Iceworm has to withstand colossal pressures. Moreover, due to the unknown chemical composition of this ocean, Iceworm's outer surface has to be chemically stable. </p>
