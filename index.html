                    <h2>The smoothest moon</h2>
                    <p>Europa is the second and the smallest of the four Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter. Being slightly smaller than Earth's moon, it orbits Jupiter every 3.5 days and is locked by gravity to Jupiter, so the the same hemisphere of the moon always faces the planet.</p>

                    <p>Europa has the smoothest surface of any known solid object in the Solar System, which consists of water ice and crisscrossed by long, linear fractures. Based on the small number of craters observed, the surface of this moon appears to be no more than 40 to 90 million years old, which is quite young in geologic terms. </p>

                    <p>The apparent youth and smoothness of the surface have led to the hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it, which could conceivably harbor extraterrestrial life. While evidence for this internal ocean is quite strong, its presence awaits confirmation by future missions. And the most challenging one would be an ice penetrating mission that will be targeted at taking water probes and reaching the ocean floor in search for possible life forms.</p>

                    <h2>The ice crust</h2>
                    <p>Europa is unique among the large icy satellites. Its geodynamically active and relatively thin (3…30 km thick) ice crust covers the global water ocean that may reach over 100 km in depth. Along with a liquid ocean, Europa also likely harbors a rocky seafloor that can supply energy and elements needed to drive metabolism. </p>

                    <p>Europa’s unusual surface is dominated by tectonic features in the form of linear ridges, bands, and fractures. The most striking of them are dark streaks crisscrossing the entire globe, called lineae. The most likely hypothesis states that the lineae on Europa may have been produced by a series of eruptions of warm ice as the crust spread open to expose warmer layers beneath. The signs of some suface activity that may be water plumes  have been detected recently by the Hubble telescope. But still there is no solid evidence that water from the inner ocean is able to reach the surface through cracks in the ice crust.</p> 

                    <p>This leads to the necessity in considering different possible ways of reaching Europa's inner ocean in the frame of future landing missions.

                    <p>The heat from tidal flexing allows the Europa's subsurface ocean to remain liquid. But several kilometers of ice above it defy the ingenuity of ice penetration tools that will constitute the payload of the future landing mission to Europa.</p>

                    <p>There exist several concepts of the Europa's ice crust penetration methods, mainly based on the drilling or ice-melting principles. These techniques require large amont of input energy to drill or melt down several-km ice crust, which may contain fragments or even layers of more dense material. This leads to the need of using nuclear-powered autonomous ice penetrators, capable of dealing with possible obstacles inside deep layers of ice.</p>

                    <!-- <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/rps/types.cfm">radioisotope power system</a> -->

                    <p>In its turn, heavy drilling/melting machinery has to be gently delivered to the surface of Europa, so a huge amount of rocket fuel has to be burned out for decelleration and landing. This will put the lander's weight up and shorten the range of available launch vehicles.</p>

                    <h2>EDEM approach</h2>

                    <p>Europa Direct Encounter Mission (EDEM) - is a brand new concept of a landing mission to Europa with optional ice penetration capabilities via kinetic impact of penetration assets with the icy surface of the moon. The mission concept is based on the application of an ultra-strong momentum exchange tether that serves for efficient deceleration of the Europa landing module and acceleration of the ice-penetration assets.</p>

                    <p>EDEM is developed with respect to the evolving technologies that will become mature by the end of the next decade, when more information about Europa's ice crust is available from the <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/europaflyby/indepth" target="_blank">Europa Multiple Flyby Mission</a>. Particulary, ultra-strong carbon-nanotube tether, similar to one that might be used in construction of the Space Elevator, is in the core of the concept. Such tether, spinned up by a pair of ion thrusters, is capable of providing velocity of several km/s on its endings. At the moment of tether release spacecraft modules, attached to the endings of the tether, will experience increase or decrease in their linear velocities depending on the direction of the tether rotation. Thus, penetration assets will experience addition in their orbital velocity, increasing the impact energy to form a deep tunnel in ice and thus reducing the working path of the drilling or ice-melting equipment that will be delivered to the impact site by the landing module. On other hand, lander will loose significant amount of delta-v, wich will significantly decrease the amount of rocket propellant, needed for deceleration and landing of the spacecraft on the surface of Europa.</p>

                    <h2>Penetration assets</h2>
                    <p>Penetration through the Europa's ice crust with kinetic impact requires application of dense projectiles, capable of withstanding high heat flux. Since the path of the projectile in ice is related to its velocity and diameter, maximization of these parameters is highly desirable. Unfortunately, maximization of the projectile's diameter is limited by the weight constraints.</p>

                    <p>Another possible way of increasing the penetration depth is through applying several projectiles aimed in the same point. In this scenario a chain of impactors must be oriented along the velocity vector, so each new impact will increase the depdth of the well left by the previous impact.</p>

                    <p>The shape of the projectile also plays important role in the formation of an elongated well. The problem of selecting proper shape, size and amount of projectiles is an ongoing research.</p>

                    <p id="velocity-undertext">The increase of the impact velocity can be achieved by several means. One of them is in the selection of an appropriate flight scheme and another is in the application of the momentum exchange tether, that is severed or released at the approach to the target.</p>

                    <!-- <h2>Tether acceleration</h2> -->
                    <p>In order to be more efficient than a regular rocket truster, momentum exchange tether must be made of an extremely strong and light material. The preffered tensile strength of such material must be over 80 GPa, which is theoretically achievable for future carbon nanotube-based fibers with density of ~1300 kg/m^3.</p>

                    <p>With desired tangential velocities at the endings of the tether, its length will exceed several hundreds of kilometers. Considering a range of issues connected with deployment of such long tether in Low Earth Orbit and significant time, needed to reach the final angular velocity, best solution is to accelerate the tether rotation during the interplanetery flight phase. </p>

                    <p>Such acceleration can be provided by the pair of ion thrusters that will start working at the the very beginning of the passive interplanetary flight, till reaching desired velocity on the approach to the Jovian System. The interplanetary flight will take up to 6-7 years with consideration of the efficient trajectory with multiple gravity assist meneuvers. Similar trajectories have been selected for all spacecraft that traveled to outer planets and beyond, including Voyager, Gallileo, Cassini and Juno. </p>


                    <p>Such long time of the flight is just enough for a pair of ion thrusters to accelerate the tether to the desired angular velocity. The thrusters will be mounted on two separate modules. One of them consists of an Europa lander and kinetic ice penetration assets (optionally). Another - is an empty rocket's upper stage, that will be thrown away into a deep space after tether release on the approach to Europa.</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>Ion thrusters will be feeded from two power sources: lander's radioisotope generator and solar pannels, mounted on the rocket's upper stage. Being extremely efficient type of rocket propulsion, ion thrusters will slowly accumulate the portion of input energy into the tether's rotation, that will be shared between two spacecraft modules in the moment of tether release.</p>

                    <p>At the moment of spacecraft launch from the Earth's surface the tether is winded around the spool, and will be slowly released during all time of the spacecraft angular acceleration to preserve the desired tension and keep the values of the overloads in the allowed range.</p>

                    <p>As the spacecraft will approach Earth and Venus several times during the interplanetary flight, solar panels will generate more energy, and ion thrusters will produce higher torque. This results in a nonuniform angular acceleration, so that most part of the angular momentum will be produced in the first half of the flight time.</p>

                    <p>At the approach to Jupiter tether will be fully unreeled, stretching on several hundred kilometers to preserve permissible values of the spacecraft module's overloads, that range from 10 to 30 units. With such long tether the whole momentum exchange system will be rotating with very low angular velocity, which makes it possible for steering engines to compensate the errors in direction and attitude.</p>

                    <p>There are many possible scenarious of tether release for the spacecraft modules, but not all of them are efficient. Considering the need in maximizing resultant velocity of the penetration assets and minimizing resultant velocity of the lander, the optimal spacecraft separation scheme consists of two steps.</p>

                    <p>According to this scheme an angle beetween the spacecraft velocity vector and the direction into the center of Jupiter, at the moment of entering the Jupiter's sphere of gravitational influence, must be held strictly to ensure that the spacecraft hyperbolic trajectory has a perijove in the Europa's orbit and Europa will be in the right position at the moment of encounter.</p>

                    <p>At the distance r from Jupiter penetration assets will separate from one of the spacecraft modules, so that its resultant trajectory is targeted towards the oncoming Europa. This will increase the impact velocity by the Europa's orbital velocity and a bit more due to the Europa's gravity. In such scenario the impact velocity can reach 30..40 km/s depending on the distance from Jupiter at the moment of separation.

                    <p>The rest of the spacecraft will loose a portion of it's angular momentum, but will keep enough energy for the second separation to be efficient. It will keep moving along its trajectory to meet an outgoing Europa in the perijove. </p>

                    <p>At the moment of close approach to Europa the spacecraft modules will separate from the tether so that the lander will be targeted against the system's linear velocity vector and the counterweight (empty booster) will be targeted along it. So, the lander's resultant velocity will be the difference between it's tangential velocity of the rotation motion and the spacecraft's linear velocity. In the best possible case the value of the resultant velocity will be close to the Europa's orbital velocity.</p>

                    <p>After the direct placement in the Europa Low Orbit by releasing the tether, the lander can use its low-thrust chemical rocket engines to land near the site of the impact. The well in the ice crust will serve as a guiding route for the autonomous vechicle to sink down to the deep layers of the pliable warm ice, or directly into the liquid ocean.</p>

At the moment of launch from Earth these modules are assembled in a single piece and the tether is reeled on the spool that is placed on top of the booster.</p>

                    <p class="block-p">The booster, is a modified version of Centaur rocket stage that utilizes high-impulse cryogenic components: liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. It will accelerate the spacecraft to reach the required Earth escape velocity. After its end of work the booster will not separate from the spacecraft, but will serve as a counterweight in the tethered system. For these reasons it will be equipped with spin-producing ion thruster (or a set of ion thrusters) and solar pannels.</p>

                    <!-- <div > -->
                    <p class="block-p">The lander, that makes up the spacecraft's second module, is equipped with the same ion thruster to produce a pure angular momentum in the tethered system. Application of thrusters with equal thrust allows to eliminate undesirable forces that may change the spacecraft trajectory. The main lander's payload is an autonomous underwater vehicle powered by radioisotope generator (RTG). The required output power of the RTG is estimated in the range 7-10 kW. It utilizes Stirling engine for the conversion of thermal energy to electrical, so th efficiency of this process is around 35%. This is very high value comparing to thermoelectric elements that have been used on all previous deep space spacecraft.</p>
                    <!-- </div> -->

                    <p class="block-p">The energy produced by the RTG will be used by the lander's spin-producing ion thruster during the interplanetary flight. After the landing on Europa surface it will be the source for producing the ice-melting heat or torque in drillig tool. In the case of successfull application of the kinetic penetration assets, the AUV will easily get to the deep ice layers trough the well, so the power of 7-10 kW will be enough for penetration through warm ice layers.</p>

                    <p class="block-p">The kinetic penetrationn assets, is an optional payload. Their efficiency still has to be proven by the series of numeriacal simulations and laboratory tests. This is the subject of ongoing research. If included in the payload, they probably will be attached to the second module. The set of impactors will be mounted on the adapter, equiped with attitude control engines. After separation from the rotating spacecraft these engines will be used to form the sequence of impactors, oriented along the vector that is collinear to the velocity vector at the moment of impact. This will ensure that all impactors will hit the ice in the same point.</p>
